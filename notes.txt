Strategies for Offline Support:
    - Notify the user
    - Disable features
    - Cache data
    - Store user actions

    - AsyncStorage
    - SecureStore
    - SQLite

Here we have implemented cache without redux:
if you are planning to implement cache with redux you have to use following parts in your project:
    - Actions
    - Action Types
    - Reducers
    - Middleware
    - redux-thunk
    - redux-persist
